An idea I got from SomebodyMakeThis Sub Reddit — a Daily Financial Dashboard.

# dev log

a web based dashboard
- Daily data entry form (cleaner than Excel)
- Daily data entry with categories (revenue, expenses, investments)
- All data stored by date, accessible anytime
- Dashboard with filters (day/week/month/year)
- Auto calculations for totals, profits, etc.
- Dashboard with charts and breakdowns
- Daily/weekly/monthly/yearly filters
- Date range picker
- Everything runs in the browser (localStorage)
- Works on any device
- Pre-loaded with sample data so you can see how it looks

Theme: Red and Black Dark Mode

Works fully offline (no internet needed)
✅ Filters by day, week, month, year, or custom range
✅ Tracks revenue, expenses, and investments
✅ Clean dashboard, charts, and list view
✅ Dark theme, mobile-friendly

No logins, no cloud. Just open and go.

Hope it helps — and thanks for sparking the idea!
